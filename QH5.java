//  Write a java program which displays an appropriate name for a person, using a 
//  combination of nested if and compound conditions. Ask the user for a gender, first 
//  name, last name and age. If the person is female and 20 or over, ask if she is married. 
//  If so, display "Mrs." in front of her name. If not, display "Ms." in front of her name. If 
//  the female is under 20, display her first and last name. If the person is male and 20 or 
//  over, display "Mr." in front of his name. Otherwise, display his first and last name. Note 
//  that asking a person if they are married should only be done if they are female and 20 
//  or older, which means you will have a single if and else nested inside one of your if 
//  statements. Also, did you know that with an if statements (or else), the curly braces are 
//  optional when there is only one statement inside?
